            Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP; Filipino: Politeknikong Unibersidad ng Pilipinas)
             is a coeducational state university in Manila, Philippines. It was founded on 19 October 1904, as the Manila Business School (MBS) 
             and as part of Manila's public school system. It was eventually promoted to a chartered state university in 1978, by virtue of Presidential Decree 1341.
              PUP has more than 20 branches and campuses across Central Luzon, Southern Luzon and Metro Manila. With over 70,000 enrolled students, PUP claims to be the largest 
              state university in the Philippines by student population.
